Run this python file to convert ROSbag files to las or laz.
The intended use is to convert LiDAR pointclouds bagged in ROS to something more easily viewable and cross-platform like a LAS or LAZ format.
You will need to run this on a ROS compatable machine.
This has only been tested on ROS Noetic running Ubuntu 20.04
The converted LAS/LAZ files were able to open in CloudCompare on macOS
